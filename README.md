# Node.js File System Operations

This Node.js project demonstrates various file system operations using the built-in `fs` module, as well as working with paths and directory names in ES modules.

## Concepts Covered

- **File System Operations**: This project covers basic file system operations such as reading from and writing to files using Node.js's `fs` module.

- **Path Handling**: It includes handling file paths using the `path` module to ensure platform-independent path manipulation.

- **ES Modules**: The project utilizes ES modules (`import` and `export` syntax) for organizing and modularizing the codebase.

## Features Implemented

- **File Reading**: The project includes functionality to read from files using the `fs.readFile` method.

- **File Writing**: It demonstrates writing to files using the `fs.writeFile` method.

- **Streaming**: Streaming functionality is implemented for efficiently handling large files using streams (`fs.createReadStream` and `fs.createWriteStream`).

- **Directory Name**: The `__dirname` global variable is utilized within ES modules to reference the directory name of the current module.
